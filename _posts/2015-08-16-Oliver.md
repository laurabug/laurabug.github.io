Oliver is my dog! He is a 1 1/2 year old Havanese.  My husband and I adopted him last year (2014) from an amish breader in Lancaster County.

This was his first car ride, from PA to MA!  Long day, where we found out he gets car sick, and really doesnt like to be in the car that long.

Oliver has a lot of personality.  He loves to be with people, and his favorite thing to do is lick you.

Everyone we meet says he looks like a Ewok from Star Wars.  So, for Halloween we dressed him up as one!

His 1st birthday was in November.  Becuase Stephen and I dont have kids, we spoil Oliver, so we celebrated his birthday like he was a kid.  We bought him a giant stuffed reindeer, and I made him a doggie friendly cupcake with peanutbutter frosting, decorated with treats!

We love christmas!  This was our Christmas card photo this year.

We live in Boston, MA.  This year we got over 100 inches of snow, and this also happened to be Oliver's first full winter.  He was not always a fan of the cold and wet, but he loved to run and jump through the snow.

Despite his size, Oliver loves to run and play.  He can jump pretty high, and loves to play with soccer balls, and frisbees.  He also loves to do agility.  Agility is a dog sport where they follow commands and run through obsticals.  Stephen asked for the agility set for christmas, and now he does agility with Oliver in the park all the time!
