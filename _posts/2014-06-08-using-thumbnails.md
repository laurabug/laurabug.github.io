From teacher to Frontend developer, how, why, but your so good at teaching!?  These were just two of the many questions I have received ever since telling people that I left my job, and decided to change my career path drastically.  

For as long as I can remember, I had wanted to be a teacher.  I remember playing school with my little sister, and helping her learn to read and write.  I went to college and graduate school to be the best teacher I could be.  I worked for a year as a tutor and then three in classrooms.  But something still wasnâ€™t right.  

When I was in college, I remember having a hard time with my decision to be a teacher.  I even thought about transferring schools and changing my major a few times, but I never could put my finger on what to change to.  So I stuck it out and worked really hard.  

When I became a teacher, I loved aspects of my job.  Interacting with the kids, telling jokes, being sarcastic, and having many of them love me for what I was doing for them was amazing.  I made some great friends too.  Some of my fellow teachers were inspiring and made me want to work harder, so I could be like them.   I also still had this pull inside me, though.  This thing telling me I could do more.  But I had no idea what that could be. 

Of the 4 years that I worked with my degree in various jobs, one thing was always consistent.  I was really good with computers and I was the person everyone went to for help fixing something, or trying something new.  Any time there was a technology upgrade, or a new tool for us to use, I was the first to start digging in.  Technology was extremely important to me and I knew that my students craved it as well.  Unfortunately all of the places I worked were not accommodating to such a need, and that is where I found myself bringing my own tools into the classroom.  

About 2 years into teaching, I started to realize that I needed to help education move in a more technological direction.  I was teaching my students the same things that I was taught and that was not going to help them in the future.  I knew that things like computer coding, and internet safety were topics that needed to be tackled but in a low income community, there were no tools to do that with.   This was when I stated to look into the Educational Technology world.  I wanted to see who was out there changing this very problem.  As I began to look, I found that I wanted to be in that world too, making a larger impact on education.  Unfortunately I was not qualified for those jobs because I was also lacking the ability to code. 

In March of 2015, after a few failed job searches, and feeling down, I decided to jump into coding.  Starting with HTML and CSS and quickly falling in love with the way I could manipulate the page and make things more user friendly.  I also worked with Javascript and learned the basics.  

In June of 2015, I was hired as an intern at Kinsights, an advice sharing and support network for parents, where parents can work with each other to help with everything from the common cold to a rare medical issue.   I was tasked with re-working the entire frontend of the website to improve speed, as well as DRY up the code.  As the summer went on, I got faster, more confident in my skills, and kept falling in love with what I was doing.  

Working in technology has brought more joy to my life then I could have anticipated. As  teacher I was tired and frustrated with what I was being asked to do, and what I was not allowed to do. Now that I am in technology, I know that I will some day be able to work in EdTech and start to make those changes for all students.  

I look at this career change as not something where I hated everything and randomly chose to do something else, but the opportunity to do more in the field that I worked so hard to be in.  I have been given this opportunity to change the world of education and I am here to do that.  Hopefully sooner rather than later.
